An extensible interactive fiction engine written in python 3.

Thoroughly a work-in-progress, and currently incomplete.

## Rationale

The most popular way of creating parser-based interactive fiction is to use the inform7 programming language. By design, inform7 is very verbose, and while this makes it more approachable for those inexperienced with programming, more experienced developers tend to find it fiddly and frustrating.

This engine attempts to combine the power of inform7 with the flexibility and ease of python 3.
